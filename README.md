# TSP

**The travelling salesman problem** (also called the traveling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problem in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization), important in [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) and [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research).

The [travelling purchaser problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_purchaser_problem) and the [vehicle routing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) are both generalizations of TSP.

In the [theory of computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory), the decision version of the TSP (where given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has a tour of at most L) belongs to the class of [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) problems. Thus, it is possible that the [worst-case running time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best,_worst_and_average_case) for any algorithm for the TSP increases [superpolynomially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Superpolynomial_time) (but no more than [exponentially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis)) with the number of cities.

The problem was first formulated in 1930 and is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. It is used as a [benchmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)) for many optimization methods. Even though the problem is computationally difficult, many [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) and [exact algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_algorithm) are known, so that some instances with tens of thousands of cities can be solved completely and even problems with millions of cities can be approximated within a small fraction of 1%.

The TSP has several applications even in its purest formulation, such as [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning), [logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics), and the manufacture of [microchips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit). Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as [DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing). In these applications, the concept city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a [similarity measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure) between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources will want to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources; in such problems, the TSP can be imbedded inside an [optimal control problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control). In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed
